GraphToCAD -> Transforms graphs from Excel spreadsheets into custom CAD entities. (tested in BricsCAD)

LISP routine that creates a VBA routine to import graphs that are converted to CAD entities.

It can be used, for example, to copy graphs of surveys such as SPT (Standard penetration tests), as CAD entities, and choosing the properties of each entity (layer, color, size,...).

(A video will be uploaded soon to demonstrate this code)
